# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

>## 🔥 Lit Protocol Example


## 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn (v1.x)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

🚨 If you are using a version < v18 you will need to remove `openssl-legacy-provider` from the `start` script in `package.json`

> 1️⃣ clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/lit-protocol
```

> 3️⃣ in a terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

🚨 if your contracts are not deployed to localhost, you will need to update the default network in `App.jsx` to match your default network in `hardhat-config.js`.

```bash
cd lit-protocol
yarn start
```

> 2️⃣ install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd lit-protocol
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> 4️⃣ in a terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

🚨 if you are not deploying to localhost, you will need to run `yarn generate` (using node v16.x) first and then fund the deployer account. To view account balances, run `yarn account`. You will aslo need to update `hardhat-config.js` with the correct default network.

👀 Side Quest: we need to update this process to use node v18.x 🪄

```bash
cd lit-protocol
yarn deploy
```
> 🔥🔥 using Lit Protocol => you can update the access control conditions in `packages/react-app/src/helpers/Lit.js` to control who can access the encrypted content. Example is set for current address to have an ETH balance of 0.000001 ETH or more.

```javascript
const accessControlConditions = [
  {
    contractAddress: "",
    standardContractType: "",
    chain: "ethereum",
    method: "eth_getBalance",
    parameters: [":userAddress", "latest"],
    returnValueTest: {
      comparator: ">=",
      value: "1000000000000", // 0.000001 ETH
    },
  },
];
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

🚨📡 To deploy to a public domain, use `yarn surge`. You will need to have a surge account and have the surge CLI installed. There is also the option to deploy to IPFS using `yarn ipfs` and `yarn s3` to deploy to an AWS bucket 🪣 There are scripts in the `packages/react-app/src/scripts` folder to help with this.`

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
